            <p class="section-content">
                As the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for the complete architecture and implementation. I designed and built the RESTful API backend with Express.js, implementing secure authentication using JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing. I created all database schemas and models using Mongoose, ensuring efficient data relationships between users, products, and orders. On the frontend, I developed a responsive React application with global state management using Context API, integrated Stripe for payment processing, and implemented protected routes with role-based access control. I also handled image uploads using Multer, configured CORS policies, and deployed both frontend and backend to production environments.

            <h2 class="section-title">Learning Journey</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                I started this project to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical full-stack development. Before this, I had worked with frontend and backend separately, but never connected them in a production-like environment. Through this project, I learned how to design RESTful APIs following industry conventions, implement secure authentication flows, and manage complex state across a React application. The experience of integrating third-party services like Stripe taught me how to read documentation effectively and handle asynchronous operations. I also gained deeper understanding of database design, particularly how to structure schemas for optimal query performance and maintain data relationships. Most importantly, I learned the importance of planning architecture before writing code, which significantly reduced debugging time and improved code maintainability.

                <p class="challenge-text">
                    After implementing JWT authentication, tokens would become invalid after page refresh, logging users out unexpectedly and creating poor user experience.
                </p>
                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented persistent JWT handling by storing tokens in memory and using HTTP-only cookies for sensitive data. Added token refresh logic and middleware to validate tokens on protected routes, ensuring seamless authentication across sessions.

                    Frontend requests to backend API were being blocked due to CORS errors, preventing communication between React app and Express server.

                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Configured Express CORS middleware with proper origin settings and credential handling. Set up Vite proxy configuration for development environment to route API requests through the same domain, eliminating cross-origin issues.

                    Managing cart state between local storage and database while keeping UI in sync was causing inconsistencies when users logged in or out.

                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented a unified cart management system using React Context API that handles both authenticated and guest users. Created merge logic to combine guest carts with user accounts upon login, ensuring no items are lost during authentication.

                    <strong>Solution:</strong> Integrated Multer for file handling and implemented image compression before storage. Added file type validation and size limits, then configured CDN-style serving of images to improve load performance.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    This project significantly strengthened my full-stack development capabilities. I gained hands-on experience with authentication flows, API design patterns, database optimization, and third-party integrations. The process taught me how to debug complex issues spanning multiple layers of the stack, from database queries to frontend rendering. I'm particularly proud of implementing secure authentication and payment processing, as these are critical features in production applications.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If I were to rebuild this project, I would implement comprehensive unit and integration testing using Jest and React Testing Library from the start. I'd also optimize database queries further by implementing caching strategies with Redis, and add monitoring tools to track performance metrics. Additionally, I would incorporate TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience throughout the codebase.
